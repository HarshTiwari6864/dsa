/*Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).*/


//hewre we use two pointer tech to solve where if value is found sub arr index is plused if not only main arry index is +1 in last we check if i is == to length of sub array and return value
